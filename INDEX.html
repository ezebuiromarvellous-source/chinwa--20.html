      <p>Dogs have always been my favorite creatures because of some of the awesome things they do. For example,<br>there is something amazing and captivating about their undieing loyalty towards their owners.<br>They can even go as far as sacrificing their lives just to safe their owners and this is some thing I find truly thrilling and wonderful.</p>
      <h2>Some of the cool facts about Dogs are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Super sense of smell(A Dog's sense of smell is 40 times greater than that of human)</li>
        <li>Dreamers like us(Dogs dream while sleeping)</li>
        <li>Heart to Heart Connection(when Dogs and their favorite humans look into each others eyes, both release oxytocin.<br>the love hormone, which strengthens the bond just like between parents and babies)</li>
      </ul>
